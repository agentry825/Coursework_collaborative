# Learning Log â€“ Grey College JCR Website Project

## Entry 1 â€“ Week 1: Getting Set Up and Figuring Things Out

### âœ… What Iâ€™ve Done
- Met with the JCR President to chat about what needed doing on the site and to get a rough plan.
- Took a look at how the websiteâ€™s running on WSL Ubuntu and figured out how uploads were being handled via SFTP.
- Got my development environment working locally so I could test changes before pushing them live.
- Went through the new MCR content they wanted on the site and made a task list.

### ðŸ“š What Iâ€™ve Learned
- Using `lftp` with SFTP on WSL is actually pretty straightforward, but takes some practice to avoid mistakes.
- The Linux setup meant I had to think a bit differently about file paths and permissions.
- Talking with someone non-technical (like the JCR President) helped me understand how to ask better questions.
- Planning properly at the start makes a big difference later on.

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Learn React properly so I can build better and more flexible site features.
- Automate uploads so Iâ€™m not doing the same repetitive stuff every time.
- Work closely with the President to make sure what I build is actually useful.
- Establish better git procedures to ensure commit messages are relevant.

### ðŸ”œ Next Steps
- Write a Bash script to handle image uploads quickly and safely.
- Make a few small edits to the site and get feedback to build confidence.
- Start going through React tutorials to understand how components work.
- Set up a proper commit system to track what Iâ€™m doing.
