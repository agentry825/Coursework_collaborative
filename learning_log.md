# Learning Log â€“ Grey College JCR Website Project

## Entry 1 â€“ Week 1: Getting Set Up and Figuring Things Out

### âœ… What Iâ€™ve Done
- Met with the JCR President to chat about what needed doing on the site and to get a rough plan.
- Took a look at how the websiteâ€™s running on WSL Ubuntu and figured out how uploads were being handled via SFTP.
- Got my development environment working locally so I could test changes before pushing them live.
- Went through the new MCR content they wanted on the site and made a task list.

### ðŸ“š What Iâ€™ve Learned
- Using `lftp` with SFTP on WSL is actually pretty straightforward, but takes some practice to avoid mistakes.
- The Linux setup meant I had to think a bit differently about file paths and permissions.
- Talking with someone non-technical (like the JCR President) helped me understand how to ask better questions.
- Planning properly at the start makes a big difference later on.

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Learn React properly so I can build better and more flexible site features.
- Automate uploads so Iâ€™m not doing the same repetitive stuff every time.
- Work closely with the President to make sure what I build is actually useful.
- Establish better git procedures to ensure commit messages are relevant.

### ðŸ”œ Next Steps
- Write a Bash script to handle image uploads quickly and safely.
- Make a few small edits to the site and get feedback to build confidence.
- Start going through React tutorials to understand how components work.
- Set up a proper commit system to track what Iâ€™m doing.

## ðŸ“… Entry 2 â€“ Week 2: Small Wins and Feedback Loops

### âœ… What Iâ€™ve Done
- Wrote a Bash script to upload files using `lftp`, which now saves loads of time.
- Made small text changes and showed them to the President for feedback.
- Started building the MCR page in React with placeholder content to get the layout right.
- Committed everything to Git and showed the President the repo so he stays in the loop.
- I hosted the first meeting of the website committee!
- Some of the second and third year Comp Sci's reviewed my React component structure, and it helped me spot two bugs I missed.
- Adjusted colour choices based on feedback from a few students who found it hard to read.

### ðŸ“š What Iâ€™ve Learned
- Automating even simple tasks improves focusâ€”it made testing much quicker.
- Getting early feedback saved me from overbuilding something based on assumptions.
- React felt confusing at first, especially props and JSX, but breaking it into small components helped.
- GitHub collaboration worked better once I wrote proper commit messages and clear README notes.
- I initially assumed the President would want things to look a certain way, turns out he cares more about simplicity.
- I shouldâ€™ve involved him earlier in some layout decisions, which lead to me having to recode stuff. Next time, Iâ€™ll mock up first before coding.
- Realised I was overcomplicating early commits; splitting changes into smaller chunks helped track issues better.

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Make the MCR page more polished and mobile-friendly.
- Understand React state and start handling simple user input.
- Keep version control organised and well-documented for others.

### ðŸ”œ Next Steps
- Complete the layout for the MCR section and test on mobile.
- Start exploring React forms and managing state with `useState`.
- Ask for another round of feedback before integrating anything new.
