# Learning Log â€“ Grey College JCR Website Project

## Entry 1 â€“ Week 1: Getting Set Up and Figuring Things Out

### âœ… What Iâ€™ve Done
- Met with the JCR President to chat about what needed doing on the site and to get a rough plan.
- Took a look at how the websiteâ€™s running on WSL Ubuntu and figured out how uploads were being handled via SFTP.
- Got my development environment working locally so I could test changes before pushing them live.
- Went through the new MCR content they wanted on the site and made a task list.

### ðŸ“š What Iâ€™ve Learned
- Using `lftp` with SFTP on WSL is actually pretty straightforward, but takes some practice to avoid mistakes.
- The Linux setup meant I had to think a bit differently about file paths and permissions.
- Talking with someone non-technical (like the JCR President) helped me understand how to ask better questions.
- Planning properly at the start makes a big difference later on.

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Learn React properly so I can build better and more flexible site features.
- Automate uploads so Iâ€™m not doing the same repetitive stuff every time.
- Work closely with the President to make sure what I build is actually useful.
- Establish better git procedures to ensure commit messages are relevant.

### ðŸ”œ Next Steps
- Write a Bash script to handle image uploads quickly and safely.
- Make a few small edits to the site and get feedback to build confidence.
- Start going through React tutorials to understand how components work.
- Set up a proper commit system to track what Iâ€™m doing.

## ðŸ“… Entry 2 â€“ Week 2: Small Wins and Feedback Loops

### âœ… What Iâ€™ve Done
- Wrote a Bash script to upload files using `lftp`, which now saves loads of time.
- Made small text changes and showed them to the President for feedback.
- Started building the MCR page in React with placeholder content to get the layout right.
- Committed everything to Git and showed the President the repo so he stays in the loop.
- I hosted the first meeting of the website committee!
- Some of the second and third year Comp Sci's reviewed my React component structure, and it helped me spot two bugs I missed.
- Adjusted colour choices based on feedback from a few students who found it hard to read.

### ðŸ“š What Iâ€™ve Learned
- Automating even simple tasks improves focusâ€”it made testing much quicker.
- Getting early feedback saved me from overbuilding something based on assumptions.
- React felt confusing at first, especially props and JSX, but breaking it into small components helped.
- GitHub collaboration worked better once I wrote proper commit messages and clear README notes.
- I initially assumed the President would want things to look a certain way, turns out he cares more about simplicity.
- I shouldâ€™ve involved him earlier in some layout decisions, which lead to me having to recode stuff. Next time, Iâ€™ll mock up first before coding.
- Realised I was overcomplicating early commits; splitting changes into smaller chunks helped track issues better.

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Make the MCR page more polished and mobile-friendly.
- Understand React state and start handling simple user input.
- Keep version control organised and well-documented for others.

### ðŸ”œ Next Steps
- Complete the layout for the MCR section and test on mobile.
- Start exploring React forms and managing state with `useState`.
- Ask for another round of feedback before integrating anything new.

## ðŸ“… Entry 3 â€“ Week 4: Getting into Full Stack Territory (oooohhhh)

### âœ… What Iâ€™ve Done
- Began building the backend for the pool leaderboard using Node.js and Express.
- Designed the match data format with input from the President to make it easy to use.
- Created API routes and used Postman to test submitting and retrieving results.
- Added a React form to send match data to the backend.
- Co-designed the match input process with the JCR President to keep it intuitive.
- Asked a pool team member to try the form - his feedback fixed key UX issues.
- Created a short doc to explain the system to non-technical users.

### ðŸ“š What Iâ€™ve Learned
- Planning the API routes before writing them saved loads of time.
- Testing user input revealed edge cases I hadnâ€™t thought about (e.g. duplicate names, typos).
- React form state was tricky at firstâ€”I had to really understand how hooks work.
- Logging and breaking backend functions into modules helped debugging massively.
- I assumed players would input perfect data, turns out typos and odd formats are really common.
- Didnâ€™t plan for form validation until I hit errors - now adding that early in any future form.
- Backend logic became messy until I stopped and properly structured everything.

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Clean up the API structure and add error messages the frontend can display.
- Link the leaderboard to real-time updates from the backend.
- Start writing documentation for how everything fits together.

### ðŸ”œ Next Steps
- Finish backend logic and test it with real data from the committee.
- Improve the React leaderboard component to pull live data.
- Add basic validation and better user feedback in the form.

## ðŸ“… Entry 4 â€“ Week 6: Fixes, Features, and Finishing Touches

### âœ… What Iâ€™ve Done
- Cleaned up the match form with better validation and helper text.
- Got the leaderboard auto-refreshing on new match submissions.
- Added fallback messages and alerts for common errors.
- Started documenting setup, deployment, and usage for the next JCR tech officer.
- Got feedback from the JCR committee after demoing the match workflow.
- Met with the web committee again where we tested the site on mobile, working together to improve the styling

### ðŸ“š What Iâ€™ve Learned
- Good UX isnâ€™t just about visuals, itâ€™s about reducing user mistakes.
- Building for future maintainers made me rethink my naming and folder structure.
- Itâ€™s much easier to add features when the code is clean from the start.
- Taking small breaks before revisiting bugs helped me see problems more clearly. I tried to juggle too many tasks at once - some bugs slipped through until I slowed down.
- Focused too much on design at one point, when stability was the real need.
- Didnâ€™t plan my backend fallback handling early enoughâ€”caused some catch-up work later.

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Finalise all user-facing features and test on different devices.
- Wrap up documentation and onboarding notes.
- Prepare a walkthrough video for the executive committee.

### ðŸ”œ Next Steps
- Share a working demo with the President for a final sign-off.
- Add screenshots to the handover documentation to help future users understand the flow.
- Clean up unused code and do a last pass of refactoring.

## ðŸ“… Entry 5 â€“ Week 7: Wrap-Up and Reflection

### âœ… What Iâ€™ve Done
- Finished the full ELO system: players can now submit results, view rankings, and see updates in real time.
- Wrote final documentation and submitted a walk-through guide and video to the committee.
- Cleaned the codebase, added inline comments.
- Delivered everything with feedback from multiple JCR members, which made the system way more usable.
- Elected new members to the website committee to ensure collaboration is always part of the website manager role.
- Started to teach new members how the site operates so when I move on from the role at the end of the year handover is clean.

### ðŸ“š What Iâ€™ve Learned
- Building something real helped me grow faster than any tutorial ever could.
- Being responsible for a working system pushed me to write better, safer code.
- React and Express no longer feel daunting!!
- Explaining things to others helped me understand them better myself.
- I over-prioritised minor visual tweaks when I shouldâ€™ve focused more on robust logic.
- The walkthrough video took a while but made a big difference for clarity, definetly worth the time.
- I learned to pause, plan, and ask questions rather than rushing into code.

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Carry forward what I learned here into future full-stack projects.
- Reuse parts of this codebase in my portfolio or side projects.
- Support other student developers who want to do the same.

### ðŸ”œ Next Steps
- Automate future deployment using GitHub Actions.
- Keep improving the project after the coursework ends- this doesnâ€™t to stop here!

Overall, I am immensely grateful to this project for allowing me the time to take on a role - it has not only improved my technical knowledge and given me insights
into the life and requirements of a real software engineer, but also allowed me to get involved in my college community and create real improvement to the JCR.
